# Information-theoretic-Characterization-of-Subregular-Hierarchy
This is the repository for the project of Information-theoretic Characterization of Subregular Hierarchy

Prerequisites: Python 3, PyTorch, IPython. 



Usage:
- Step 1: Install all modules in rfutils from https://github.com/Futrell/rfutils. 

- Step 2: Github clone the repository to your directory 
- Step 3: Change directory to the folder which contain pfa.py
```bash
cd [your directory] 
```
- Step 4: Open IPython
```bash
ipython
```
- Step 5: In IPython, import pfa.py as a module
```bash
import pfa
```
- Step 6: Choose which language you are working on, for example, strictly 2-local 
```bash

```

Compute Statistical Complexity


To test your own Probabilistic Finite-state Acceptors, you should write a function in Python
